# ClimbingOutOfTheTarPit
Resources for becoming a better programmer.

# Rationale

"This code is hard to follow."

"I fixed one bug and several new bugs appeared."

"Since surpassing X lines of code, our velocity is terrible.  Implementing even a trivial change is too expensive."

What is going on?  Things were going great when this software project was small, and then slowly everything fell apart.  What happened?

You need better tools.  Better practices, conventions, and higher levels of abstraction.

It is time for you to climb [out of the tar pit](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/design/out-of-the-tar-pit.pdf).
